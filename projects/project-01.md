I worked as Korean tutor at Learning Resource Center at Leeward Community College. I met the student who needed help with Korean classes and offered them help as they needed. Mostly, I explained the basic rules of grammar, spelling, and writing tip in Korean. and Korean cultures to help understanding language Korean better and use naturally. Also student came to my conversation group, met other students who was studying Korean, learned real stuff not in the book, and practice speaking in Korean. I guided the students to develop their language and learning skills. 


English is my secondary language, so I understand how painful leaning foreign language is. I thought I could help students to understand another language because I had been there. On the first day of tutoring, my tutee and I was checking her homework together. I could tell what was correct or incorrect, but I could not tell why they were wrong. I realized I needed to study even though I am native Korean speaker. I pretended I was native English speaker and tried to analyze Korean. Unexpectedly, I ended up to understand deeply why Korean is the way it is. As I understood more my mother tongue, it was easier to answer why and my English skill also improved. I received the biggest gift in my life.


Through tutoring experience, I developed my communication skills in English and Korean while meeting student one to one and leading conversation group one to many.  I got feedback from tutee, and that helped to improve customer service and time management.
