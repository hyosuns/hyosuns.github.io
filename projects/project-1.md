Mini golf is the first simple game app that I created using MIT App Inventor 2 through the ICS 110M, Introduction to programming. This golf game consists of three holes, and each hole contains one obstacle. The ball speed goes down when it hits an obstacle or bounces on edges. Each stroke that user flings the white ball toward the hole is counted to calculate the score. When the ball goes into (black) hole, a hole is over and indicates the score.
