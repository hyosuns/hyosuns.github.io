# Overview   
I participated in my first hackathon, Hawaii Annual Code Challenge(HACC) as a team The Johnson Family. This yearâ€™s theme was sustainability, and our team chose the challenge, waste audit. The problem was that University of Hawaii Department of Sustainability does not have an efficient method to store and visualize the data they collect through the waste audit.

So, we presented two pronged approach, a software that named Gather and a hardware that named Smart Bin. The web application Gather features that an easy input form, a submission providing a delegated approach to data entry, and accurate statistics.

The Smart bin helps to get waste weight, volume, and count with little effort during the waste audit. Unfortunately, we did not get a prize, but our team kept working on the project to improve gather.
