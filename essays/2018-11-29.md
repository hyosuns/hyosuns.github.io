<p> Everyone has different learning styles. My classmate I met in Japanese class, his main learning method was transcription. He transcribed everything in the textbook by hand. Because he spent many hours to copy dialogs or example sentences into his notebook, he was poor at speaking, listening, and reading in Japanese. He got stressed out (and hand pain from writing I guess) and wondered why his grades were bad. I thought there were better strategies to learn Japanese that were much effective than transcription. 

<p> When I read the question “what design patterns have you used in your own code?,” I had a chance to think of design patterns in my code. I used to write code, stop, and test it out and repeated the steps until my program finally ran. There were some warnings, but I honestly did not care unless the programing was crushed. The reflection I saw of me was my unproductive Japanese classmate; I spent long time for bad code, got stressed and tired. 

<p> These steps are not just wasting time and effort because at least we learn something through the practices, mistakes, and experiments. However, we are able to learn better skipping cumbersome process as smart software engineer.
  
<p> According to the article, a design pattern is a general repeatable solution to a commonly occurring problem in software design, and it is not the actual code that is provided to copy and use into code. The design pattern is such a guideline for dealing with problem and makes the problem solving faster and productive.
