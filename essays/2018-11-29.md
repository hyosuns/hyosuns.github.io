<p> Everyone has different learning styles. My classmate I met in Japanese class, his main learning method was transcription. He transcribed everything in the textbook by hand. Because he spent many hours to copy dialogs or example sentences into his notebook, he was poor at speaking, listening, and reading in Japanese. He got stressed out (and hand pain from writing I guess) and wondered why his grades of oral and written tests were bad. I think there are better strategies to learn Japanese that are much effective than transcription. 

<p> When I read the question “what design patterns have you used in your own code?,” I had a chance to think of my coding style. I used to write code, stop, and test it out and repeated the steps until my program was finally running. There were some warnings, but I honestly did not care unless the programing is crushed.
