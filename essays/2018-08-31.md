I found a new word “JavaScript” while I was answering to my question, “what is the most in-demand programing languages to learn?” There were a lot of different answers, but JavaScript and Java were often mentioned as important programing languages. I was total newbie to programing at the time; just took only ICS 110M. I kept searching the difference between JavaScript and Java, and found a key. “Java is to JavaScript as ham is to Hamster”
