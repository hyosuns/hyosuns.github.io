One week ago, I was working with my classmate to create a VERY simple page that was called “a history of surfing.” We were allowed to use only HTML and CSS, and the page had to have a surfing related background image for the entire page, a short paragraph, and some pictures in divided sections. My classmate and I worked for approximately 30 minutes and got the result as below. (sigh)

<img class="ui medium center floated rounded image" src="../images/historyofsurfing.png">


Using HTML and CSS alone to create a webpage is painful because you start from scratch and need to study them to use. Especially, you do not have any sense of the designs or the skills of HTML/CSS, you are already overwhelmed at the beginning. If we spend a lot of time and a lot of efforts and receive the incomplete unsatisfied outcome as mine above, it is definitely not productive. We better get some help to develop frameworks.

Semantic UI is a development framework that provides us the ability to build incredible websites and applications, and its syntax is from natural language so that it is easy to understand and use. One of the powerful features of Semantic is countless options that are provided with many examples and also can be customized as your needs. Using options make the designs look great and professional.
