One week ago, I was working with my classmate to create a VERY simple page that was called “a history of surfing.” We were allowed to use only HTML and CSS, and the page had to have a surfing related background image for the entire page, a short paragraph, and some pictures in divided sections. My classmate and I worked for approximately 30 minutes and got the result as below. (sigh)

Using only HTML and CSS to create a webpage is painful because you start from scratch and need to study them to use. Especially, you do not have any sense of the designs or the skills of HTML/CSS, you are already overwhelmed at the beginning. If we spend a lot of time and a lot of efforts and receive the incomplete unsatisfied outcome as mine above, it is not productive. We better get some help to develop frameworks.

Semantic UI is a development framework that helps create beautiful, responsive layouts using human-friendly HTML (Semantic Website). Also, the syntax of UI is from natural language so that it is easy to use and understand.
